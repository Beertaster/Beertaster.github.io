Coming back to my project late. I found the most difficult part to be not the building of the site, but implementation. Most of the Sinatra site is structured by MVC and restful routes. These are more or less best practices that minimize the amount of coding needed and makes the code easier to understand by others, through its organization. 

I didn't think I'd find myself stuck in Visual Studio Code because I didn't realised I messed with my terminal and now it wouldn't read anything from the whole project. Or when I upload my project to Github and for some reason it won't take my db folder and all the files I generated inside. I still need to ask about that.

I kind of forgot that getting to the point that I can tinker and reload my project over and over isn't a given and everything has to be set up right.
