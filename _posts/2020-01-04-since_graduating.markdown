After college I realized that I needed more technical knowledge of programming. Despite having worked with Java, Visual Basec, Cobol, and C# every class more or less was composed of learning the same basic structure of loops, methods, and classes. Very little time was spend branching out into applications of those languages. Perhaps I should say I those classes didn't teach much about how to be a programmer.

One of my greatest issues in my job search is when I'm asked what I have coded before. From my College years I only have a project to generate a million poker hands and classify them through a bunch of switch statements, a fake website, a website that a client never intended to use from the start, and a few other final projects, like using Cobol to run standard transactions.

So I chose to do Flatiron's boot camp to over come these issues I've faced in my professional search.
